# Visual Example of the `Read` Method

## Initial State Recap

The store has the following entries after appending `"Hello"` and `"World!"`:
- **First Entry**: Length (5) + Data (`"Hello"`)
- **Second Entry**: Length (6) + Data (`"World!"`)

### File Contents After Both Appends

We will now demonstrate the process of reading the data from the file using the Read method.

Example 1: Reading the First Entry ("Hello")
We want to read the first entry at position 0.

Step-by-Step Process
Lock the Store

Purpose: Ensures that no other goroutine can modify the store while this read operation is taking place.
Visualization: The store is now locked for exclusive access.
Flush the Buffer

Purpose: Ensures all buffered data has been written to the file, and we are reading the latest data.
Visualization: Assume that the buffer is flushed successfully, and now the data in the file is up to date.
Read the Length of the Data

Length Prefix Position: pos = 0
Action: Read lenWidth bytes (which is 8 bytes) from the file starting at position 0.
Length Data: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 05
Decoded Length: 5 (this tells us that the actual data length is 5 bytes)

+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
           ^-- Read these 8 bytes (length prefix)
Output: Length of data to read is 5.
Read the Actual Data

Data Position: pos + lenWidth = 0 + 8 = 8
Action: Read 5 bytes starting at position 8.
Data: H | e | l | l | o

                               ^-- Read these 5 bytes (actual data)
Output: "Hello"
Unlock the Store

Purpose: Release the lock to allow other goroutines to access the store.
Visualization: The store is now unlocked and available for other operations.
Summary After Reading the First Entry
Data Read: "Hello"
Length Read: 5 (bytes)
Example 2: Reading the Second Entry ("World!")
We now want to read the second entry, which starts at position 13 (the end of the first entry).

Step-by-Step Process
Lock the Store

Purpose: Ensures that no other goroutine can modify the store while this read operation is taking place.
Visualization: The store is locked for exclusive access.
Flush the Buffer

Purpose: Ensures all buffered data has been written to the file, and we are reading the latest data.
Visualization: Assume that the buffer is flushed successfully, and now the data in the file is up to date.
Read the Length of the Data

Length Prefix Position: pos = 13
Action: Read lenWidth bytes (which is 8 bytes) from the file starting at position 13.
Length Data: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 06
Decoded Length: 6 (this tells us that the actual data length is 6 bytes)

+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
           ^-- Read these 8 bytes (length prefix)
Output: Length of data to read is 6.
Read the Actual Data

Data Position: pos + lenWidth = 13 + 8 = 21
Action: Read 6 bytes starting at position 21.

                                   ^-- Read these 6 bytes (actual data)
Output: "World!"
Unlock the Store

Purpose: Release the lock to allow other goroutines to access the store.
Visualization: The store is now unlocked and available for other operations.
Summary After Reading the Second Entry
Data Read: "World!"
Length Read: 6 (bytes)
Visual Summary of Read Method
For each read operation:

Lock the store to ensure thread safety.
Flush the buffer to ensure up-to-date data.
Read the length prefix from the specified position.
Read the actual data starting after the length prefix.
Unlock the store.
